# React 19 Migration Plan

## Overview
Migrate React ecosystem from 18.3.x to 19.x with all related dependencies and type definitions.

## Packages to Update
- `react`: 18.3.1 → 19.1.1
- `react-dom`: 18.3.1 → 19.1.1
- `@types/react`: 18.3.24 → 19.1.13
- `@types/react-dom`: 18.3.7 → 19.1.9

## Breaking Changes in React 19

### 1. Automatic Batching Changes
- More aggressive automatic batching across all event handlers
- May affect timing of state updates in edge cases

### 2. Concurrent Features Default
- Concurrent features enabled by default
- `startTransition` and `useDeferredValue` behavior changes
- Suspense boundaries may behave differently

### 3. StrictMode Changes
- Stricter development-time warnings
- Double-invocation of effects in development

### 4. TypeScript Changes
- Stricter typing for event handlers
- Changes to React.FC and component prop types
- New JSX transform requirements

### 5. Legacy API Removals
- Removal of deprecated APIs that were warnings in React 18
- String refs completely removed
- Legacy context API removed

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation
```bash
# Ensure current React 18 code is working
npm run build

# Check for any deprecated React APIs in use
# Search codebase for:
# - String refs
# - Legacy context API usage
# - Deprecated lifecycle methods
```

### Phase 2: Update Dependencies
```bash
npm install react@^19.1.1 react-dom@^19.1.1 @types/react@^19.1.13 @types/react-dom@^19.1.9
```

### Phase 3: Code Updates Required

#### 1. Check Event Handler Types
```typescript
// Before (React 18)
const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {}

// After (React 19) - may need stricter typing
const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>) => {}
```

#### 2. Update Component Prop Types
```typescript
// Check for any React.FC usage that might need updating
// React 19 has changes to default children prop handling
```

#### 3. Concurrent Features Impact
- Review any custom state management for batching changes
- Test components that use `useState` extensively
- Verify Suspense boundary behavior

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. **Build Testing**
   - `npm run build` - Verify TypeScript compilation
   - Check for new TypeScript errors

2. **Runtime Testing**
   - Test all major user flows
   - Pay special attention to form handling
   - Test state updates and re-renders
   - Verify modal/overlay components work correctly

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Monitor bundle size changes
   - Test rendering performance
   - Check for any new console warnings

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level: HIGH**

### High Risk Areas:
- **State Management**: Timing of state updates may change
- **Event Handling**: TypeScript types more strict
- **Concurrent Features**: Default behavior changes
- **Third-party Libraries**: May not be React 19 compatible yet

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Phased Rollout**: Test in development/staging extensively
2. **Rollback Plan**: Keep React 18 branch available
3. **Library Compatibility**: Check all major dependencies for React 19 support
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor for regressions

## Dependencies to Check for React 19 Compatibility

### Critical Dependencies:
- `@mui/material` (currently 5.18.0) - Check React 19 support
- `@reduxjs/toolkit` (currently 1.9.7) - Usually compatible
- `react-redux` (currently 8.1.3) - May need update to 9.x
- `react-router-dom` (currently 6.30.1) - Check React 19 support
- `notistack` (currently 3.0.2) - Check React 19 support

### Recommendation:
Wait for ecosystem maturity. React 19 is very new and many popular libraries may not have full support yet. Consider this migration in Q2 2024 when the ecosystem is more stable.

## Estimated Timeline
- **Preparation**: 1-2 days
- **Update & Initial Testing**: 2-3 days
- **Thorough Testing**: 1-2 weeks
- **Production Rollout**: 1 week

**Total**: 3-4 weeks for safe migration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] No runtime errors in development
- [ ] All user flows work correctly
- [ ] Performance metrics maintained
- [ ] No console warnings/errors
- [ ] Bundle size impact acceptable
